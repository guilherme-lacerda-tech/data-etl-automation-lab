    # Data ETL Automation Lab

    Independent public portfolio project for **Python**, **automation**,
    **systems integration** and **solutions engineering**.

    This repository was created from scratch with a fictional domain and
    synthetic data. It does not contain corporate code, real data, private
    endpoints, credentials, logs or proprietary rules.

    ## Problem

    Operational datasets often need validation, transformation, aggregation and reproducible reports.

    ## Objective

    Demonstrate a safe ETL workflow using only synthetic operational data.

    ## Current Features

    - CSV ingestion.
- JSON lookup data.
- SQLite output.
- Summary and manifest files.

    ## Architecture

    ```mermaid

        A["Synthetic input"] --> B["Python processing"]
        B --> C["Rules / validation"]
        C --> D["Generated local output"]
        D --> E["Future API / dashboard"]
    ```

    See [docs/architecture.md](docs/architecture.md) for details.

    ## Stack

    Current:

    `Python` `CSV` `JSON` `SQLite` `Reports`

    Planned evolution:

    - PostgreSQL
- SQLAlchemy
- PyTest
- Docker
- GitHub Actions

    ## Run Locally

    ```powershell
    python examples/run_demo.py
    ```

    The demo uses only files under `data/sample/` and writes generated output
    to ignored local folders.

    ## Repository Workflow

    This project is intended to evolve through:

    - Issues for planned work.
    - Milestones for learning phases.
    - Small branches and pull requests.
    - Releases when a useful increment is ready.

    Draft issues are documented in [docs/github-issues.md](docs/github-issues.md).
